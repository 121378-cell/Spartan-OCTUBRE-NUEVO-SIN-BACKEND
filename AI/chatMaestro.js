/**
 * CONCEPTUAL FILE: Chat Maestro
 * 
 * This file represents the central intelligence of the Spartan AI ecosystem.
 * The Chat Maestro is the primary interface for the user, responsible for:
 * 
 * 1.  **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Parsing the user's input to determine intent.
 * 2.  **Internal Routing:** Deciding which specialist or internal function to call based on the intent.
 *     - Example: If the input contains "routine" or "plan", it might trigger an action related to workout planning.
 *     - Example: If the input contains "calories" or "macros", it will consult the Nutritionist specialist.
 * 3.  **Action Execution:** Interacting with the application's state (via the shared context) to perform actions like:
 *     - Opening modals (`openModal`).
 *     - Adding or modifying data (`addRoutine`, `updateProfile`).
 *     - Scheduling events on the calendar.
 * 4.  **Specialist Coordination:** Acting as an orchestrator for the various AI specialists. It gathers information from them and synthesizes it into a coherent response for the user.
 * 5.  **Response Generation:** Formulating the final, user-facing message.
 * 
 * The actual implementation of this logic is handled by the `processUserCommand` function in `services/aiService.ts`,
 * which uses a large language model (LLM) guided by the system prompt in `AI/prompts/masterPrompt.ts`.
